Based on the video tutorials by Corey Schafer
Git is a distributed vcs, unlike centralized ones like svn or perforce.
central is located at 1 place. if this gets corrupted or damaged, you better pray there's a backup somewhere.
distributed: everyone has a local repo. your local repo has all the info the remote repo has.
its like every developer has a copy of the same repo.
2 scenarios we can start out with:
1. there's a local project you have on your computer that you want to start tracking
2. there's a remote repo you want to start tracking(eg if you're collabing with friends or work)

scenario 1:
1. navigate into the folder you want to start tracking.
2. so for eg, create a folder on your desktop. open git bash. navigate into it.
3. type "git init". this will initialize a git repo within this folder.
4. if you want to create some personal files with sensitive data that you don't want shared with other people, create a .gitignore file.
5. simply type "touch .gitignore". this is a simple textfile.
6. open this file now, and add the file names you want ignored. these files should start with "." for eg .ignorethisfile
7. add .ignorethisfile to the .gitignore file.
8. once you add files to the .gitignore file, you will no longer see them once you run "git status"

so there's 3 stages in git:
1. the working dir - this is where you start working. so any files you create, make changes to start off in this area. if you run git status, you'll see files in the working dir in red.
2. the staging area - files that have been added using the "git add" command will show up in green.
3. the .git dir (final stage)

if you want to stop tracking this with git, type "rm rf .git"
run "git status" to see the status of your files i.e which have been committed etc.
